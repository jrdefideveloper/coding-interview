# coding-interview

Just me attempting to go over concepts I haven't seen or read about it in the past 7 years. :') 

Also since I majored in an electrical engineering variant I may be seeing some of these concepts for the first time. 

# Table of contents
1. [Introduction](introduction/introduction.md)
2. [Complexity](complexity/complexity.md)
3. [Easy problems](easy-problems/easy-problems.md)

Bonus 
+ [Real problems](real-problems/real-problems.md)

# Resources I used to prepare 
Everyone's favorite [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
+ AlgoExperts 
+ Geek4Geeks 
+ I own Skiena's Algorithm Design book but it bored me to tears so I didn't end up reading it much. Sorry sir skiena 
+ Java [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) because unfortunately we're going to be using classes we never actually use in real life during the coding interviews. Like `Deque`

Youtube channels - for motivation I like to watch competitive coders code. William Lin and Alex Wice are pretty great channels to follow.
