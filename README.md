# coding-interview

Just me attempting to go over concepts I haven't seen or read about it in the past 7 years. :') 

Also since I majored in an electrical engineering variant I may be seeing some of these concepts for the first time. 

# Table of contents
1. [Introduction](introduction/introduction.md)
2. [Complexity](complexity-analysis/complexity.md)
3. [Easy problems](easy-problems/easy-problems.md)

Bonus 
+ [Real problems](real-problems/real-problems.md)

# Resources I used to prepare 
Everyone's favorite [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
+ AlgoExperts 
+ Geek4Geeks 
+ I own Skiena's Algorithm Design book but it bored me to tears so I didn't end up reading it much. Sorry sir skiena 
+ Java [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) because unfortunately we're going to be using classes we never actually use in real life during the coding interviews. Like `Deque`

Youtube channels - for motivation I like to watch competitive coders code. William Lin and Alex Wice are pretty great channels to follow. 


# How much did I study? Schedule I used? 
I had a fairly lax schedule since I'm not the type to follow stringent routine too much. My requirement for myself was to do five pomodoro's worth of studying a day. A pomodoro for me is equal to 50 minutes of study and 10 minutes of break time. 

Amortized across a month it means I study about **150 hours** a month. 

I asked my friends that have jobs at big tech about their interview efforts and they've averaged about 300-500 LeetCode problems before getting offers.  

I made a general estimate that if I managed to finish 1 problem in 1 hour then I would need to do about **300 hours** worth of studying bare minimum. This equates to two months of studying. 

Factor in the fact that I may be a bit slower than my peers then I would need to about 2.5 months of studying total with this crazy schedule. :')
