# Graphs  

A collection of nodes or values called vertices that might be related; relations between vertices are called edges. 

Examples: friends and relationships  
City maps  

# Key properties 

+ Disconnected graphs 
+ Connected graph - some path between any 2 nodes in the graph 
+ Arrows imply direction (directed graph)
+ Undirected graph has no direction (friendship on facebook)
+ Cyclic graph - has cycle - avoid infinite loops by marking nodes as visited 
+ Acyclic graph - no cycles 
+ adjacency list - nodes with list of it's edges 

# Traverse 

O(V + E) - Traversing every vertex and every edge! 

More graph problems you do and more traversals you do the more intuitive everything becomes 

## Graph traversal continued 

+ Breadth first traversal (iteration with a queue usually)
+ Depth first traversal (recursion)
