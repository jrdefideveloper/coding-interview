# Medium level problems 

I noticed top tech companies typically ask medium level questions and follow up with more medium level problems that are related to the first problem. 

In a 50 minute interview it's typicallly structured like 

1. 5 minute pleasantries - "Hi, my name is" 
2. 40 minutes of coding 
    + 5 minutes to break it down conceptually, ask questions, go through examples
    + 20 minutes to code the first original problem 
    + 10 answering and/or coding follow up questions 
    + 5 summarazing your answer and going through your code. cleaning things up. "productionizing"? 
3. 5 minutes of additional question asking "work culture, side projects, tech stack, challenges, etc"
