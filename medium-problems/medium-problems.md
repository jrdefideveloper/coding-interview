# Medium level problems 

I noticed top tech companies typically ask medium level questions and follow up with more medium level problems that are related to the first problem. 

In a 50 minute interview it's typicallly structured like 

1. 5 minute pleasantries - "Hi, my name is" 
2. 40 minutes of coding 
    + 5 minutes to break it down conceptually, ask questions, go through examples
    + 20 minutes to code the first original problem 
    + 10 answering and/or coding follow up questions 
    + 5 summarazing your answer and going through your code. cleaning things up. "productionizing"? 
3. 5 minutes of additional question asking "work culture, side projects, tech stack, challenges, etc"

+ `bst-construction` - searching, insertion, deletion. Deletion edge cases are difficult. If I were to have to do this in 15 minutes I'd get really pressured. Psyduck. 
+ `validate-bst` - This is easier when every key is unique. Slight nuances depending on exact interview question when there should be <= >= for each node value in the true compared to the left and right subtrees. Iterative approach doesn't work as well when theres a equal to greater than case. Recursive code is so short and simple yet so hard to put together.

`booleanExpression ? expression1 : expression2` - Somehow I sometimes get the ? and : position confused... lol.
