Most popular algorithms that may show in the interviews 

+ Depth first search 
+ Breadth first search 
+ In order, preorder, postorder traversal 
+ Level order traversal (BFS)


# Depth First Search 

+ O(v + e) time complexity 
+ O(v) space complexity (array holds v different nodes) in the worst case scenario it takes an addtional o(v) space because we're adding a bunch of frames into the call stack.
