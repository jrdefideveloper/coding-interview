# Hard problems 

Haven't solved any of these yet. I hate it when tech questions use these during the phone screen. 

**Algoexperts** has 46 hard problems.

3. `Lowest common manager` - very difficult to implement and visualize (hard) problem

1. `Four Number Sum` - Reviewed {Two number sum O(n) optimal , Three number sum O(n^2) optimal}

Took car to get airbag recall done. Loss of momentum. :( 

1. `Four Number Sum` - Reviewed {Two number sum O(n) optimal , Three number sum O(n^2) optimal}
Sidenote `two number sum` and `three number sum` are O(n) and O(n * nlogn) best time complexity respectively.  This one is O(n^2). Solution is hard to think of yourself in a 30 minute window. :( 
2. `Subarray sort` -

1. `Subarray sort` - Using a isOutOfOrder function really helped. 
2. `Largest range` - Interesting problem  
3. `Min rewards` - Interesting greedy algorithm 
4. `Zig zag traverse` - Just about the weirdest problem ever.  
5. `Same BSTs` - Damn this one is so hard. 

# *September 22, 2021* 

1. `Validate three nodes` - Not so bad actually. Code is clean too. 
2. `Max Path Sum In Binary Tree` -  

# *September 23, 2021* 

1. `Max Path Sum In Binary Tree` -  This is no doubt a hard problem... lol 
2. `Max sum increasing subsequence` - 


# *October 4, 2021* 

1. `Multi string search`  -
